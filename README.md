Sic Infra is a 2D game made with Unity and our final project as part of Holberton School's Foundations curriculum.

## Introduction

### Story
Ever since we were kids we dreamt of making a video game, the wonder of how it all worked always fascinated us. After nine months of hard work learning new concepts, front-end & back-end technologies, different programming languages, we were given free reigns to use whatever technology we wished for a final project presentation. Naturally, the little kid inside of us geared towards making that video game we so desired and even though it's not the best game out there (it has it's bugs and glitches) we're still proud of it and of ourselves for having taken on such a huge task in a limited amount of time.

We decided to use the game engine, Unity, and C# as the scripting language. Even though we had never used these tools before we decided to take a gamble for the following reasons:  
1. Both Unity and C# are part of the industry standards and  
2. We see the potential in Unity as a tool for developing apps that many departments in the work industry could benefit from  

To learn more about our struggles and outcomes read our [blog post](https://2392.medium.com/sic-infra-a-project-summary-blog-6733b6c1f843) as we reflect on everything we learned during and after the project.
